# Craig's Boards

## This app is a craigslist clone built with Node JS
### It is not 100% complete, I just used it as a demo for my ongoing course, _Code with Node: Learn by Doing_ on [DevSprout.io](https://www.devsprout.io)
### The Surf Shop project from Code w/ Node will be similar to this application, but not completely the same

#### This application uses webpack (`npm run build`) for precompiling the ES6+ syntax in the /src directory and outputting it to /public/javascripts
