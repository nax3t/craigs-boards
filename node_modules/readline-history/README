/* Monkey-patching history support into readline.
 * Usage: createInterface is like readline's createInterface, but also takes a path and 
 * a maximum (in-memory) history length. Also it's async, so use CPS.
 *
 * maxDiskSize is maximum bytes that can go in disk history
 * before a rotation. Rotation is super simple, removes previous .old, renames to .old
 *
 * console.log(module.example) to see an example of how to use.
